# wgo.js Theme for [Sabaki](http://sabaki.yichuanshen.de/)

I made this theme because I saw a request to make a theme for Sabaki that mimicked the wgo.js theme. I used the stones and wooden board images right from the wgo.js project itself. Since there were several choices for the black stones, white stones, and wooden board images, I had the theme default to the following.

* Choose from the four black stones images randomly.
* Choose from the eleven white stones images randomly.
* Choose wood1.jpg for the wooden board image.

Since there was no background image, I kept the granite-grey background from my [walnut theme](https://github.com/3kakakhel/sabaki-walnut-theme) since it is fairrly neutral without being a bland color.

I hope you enjoy it. Improvements are welcome.
