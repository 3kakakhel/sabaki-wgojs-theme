# wgo.js Theme for [Sabaki](http://sabaki.yichuanshen.de/)

I made this theme because I saw a request to make a high resolution theme for Sabaki that mimicked the wgo.js theme. While all the stone images have a resolution ~350 ppi, there are a variety of stone image sizes available ranging from 32x32 upto 512x512. This theme defaults to using the 128x128 stone image size, though the `style.css` may be modified to point to the desired stone images. There are a variety of woods available as well, though their resolution is lower, at 72 ppi. Since there was no background image, I kept the granite-grey background from my [walnut theme](https://github.com/3kakakhel/sabaki-walnut-theme) since it is fairly neutral without being a bland color.

Sourcing information is available in the Credits section below.
I hope you enjoy it. Improvements are welcome.
